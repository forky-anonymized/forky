- Reproducing findings in the paper: Just run 
- Finding new bugs: overwrite files in modified to each directory (It contains patches to not trigger already found discrepancies)

# How to Generate Testcases with Fuzzer
WARNING: Fuzzing phase of forky-eth2 is **extremely slow** due to it is not optimized now!
```
# Install Rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# How to Run Lighthouse Consensus Spec Test
```
# Put testcase in lighthouse/testing/ef_tests/forky/pyspec_tests/

# Run 
# This takes time as cargo test builds lighthouse from the scratch
./execute_lighthouse.sh

# Results can be found in forky-eth2/logs_lighthouse

```

# How to Run Nimbus Consensus Spec Test
```
# Build
cd nimbus-23.5.1
mv tmp.git .git
make consensus_spec_tests_mainnet -j4
cd ..

# Put testcases in forky-eth2/testcases

# Run
./execute_nimbus.sh

# Results can be found in forky-eth2/logs_nimbus

```

# How to Run Prysm Consensus Spec Test
```
# Install Go
sudo apt install golang-go 

# Install Bazel
sudo apt install bazel-6.2.1

# Build
cd prysm-4.0.7
bazel build //... --build_tag_filters=forky
cd ..

# Put testcases in forky-eth2/testcases

# Run
./execute_prysm.sh

# Results (FAILED) can be found in forky-eth2/logs_prysm

```

# How to Run Teku Consensus Spec Test
If you generated too much test cases, then you should split them (Use _split_teku_testcases.sh_ and _splitted_generate_teku.sh_)
```
# Install SDK Manager
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash  

# Install Gradle
sdk install gradle 7.6.1

# Put testcases in forky-eth2/testcases

# Generate testcase classes
./generate_teku.sh

# Run
cd ./teku-23.6.2/eth-reference-tests
gradle referenceTest
cd ../..

# Build Fail is expected result; It means there exists failed test case.

# Results can be found in forky-eth2/teku-23.6.2/eth-reference-tests/build/reports/tests/referenceTest


# If fail due to too many test cases (e.g., JVM heap space is exhausted), please do this at the last of validation (After finishing executing other clients)
./split_teku_testcases.sh
./splitted_generate_teku.sh
